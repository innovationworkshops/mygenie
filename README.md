With one-click deployment  using the Heroku Button, you accomplished the following:

    * Installed an instance of a MySQL database (JawsDB MySQL)
    * Created two tables in MySQL schema (Customers & Leads tables)
    * Deployed a pre-written PHP CRUD application 
    * Configured your PHP CRUD application to connect to the newly installed MySQL database

When you sign in to your Heroku instance, you can navigate to “https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps” to manage your newly installed app, add more resources from Heroku Elements (https://elements.heroku.com/), configure access & settings or monitor metrics & activity. 



Happy exploring!
